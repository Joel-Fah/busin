# BusIn for Admins

<!-- Intro image placeholder: replace the path below with your final image -->
![Intro – BusIn also serves the school staff and administration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Joel-Fah/busin/refs/heads/main/assets/images/docs/busin_for_admins.png)

## Why BusIn helps admins
BusIn streamlines campus transport operations—reducing no‑shows, improving capacity planning, and giving you real‑time oversight of vehicles, routes, and demand.

## Key capabilities
- Live operations board: vehicles, occupancy, ETAs, and incidents
- Seat management: block rows, set capacity, or enable free seating
- Route & schedule planning with templates and exceptions (holidays, exams)
- Digital ticketing with QR validation and fraud controls
- Notifications: service alerts, detours, and targeted messaging
- Analytics: utilization, on‑time performance, demand heatmaps
- Policy controls: eligibility (student/staff), pickup windows, and priorities
- Roles & permissions for dispatchers, planners, and auditors

## Operational workflows
1. Plan routes and time bands; publish changes with versioning.
2. Configure seat rules (capacity, blocks, accessibility zones).
3. Monitor live trips; respond to delays and send alerts.
4. Validate tickets at boarding; reconcile exceptions.
5. Review daily reports; adjust supply to demand trends.

## Integrations
- Identity: connect to campus SSO or student directories
- Payments: integrate preferred PSPs for passes and single rides
- Hardware: QR validators, turnstiles, or handheld scanners
- Data exports: CSV, secure APIs for BI tools

## Compliance and security
- Fine‑grained access control and audit trails
- Data retention windows and export on request
- PCI‑compliant payment flows via providers; no raw card storage
- Optional PII minimization and anonymized analytics

## Dashboards and reports
- Utilization by route/time, load factors, and peak/off‑peak analysis
- On‑time performance with delay causes
- No‑show rates, cancellation windows, and recovery actions
- Feedback trends and service quality KPIs

## Best practices
- Use demand heatmaps to shift capacity before crunch weeks
- Keep seat blocks flexible for accessibility and events
- Automate alerts for recurring detours or construction
- Run pilot changes on a subset of routes and evaluate

## Troubleshooting
- High no‑show rate: tighten booking windows or add reminders
- Over‑capacity trips: add departures or limit duplicates
- Scanner fails offline: enable delayed validation sync
- Missing routes for students: check eligibility rules and roster sync
