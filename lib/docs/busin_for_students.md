## Why BusIn helps students
BusIn makes getting to, from, and around campus simpler. Reserve a seat, track buses in real time, keep a digital ticket, and get timely updates—all in one place.

## What you can do
- Book seats in advance (or on the go)
- See routes, stops, and schedules at a glance
- Pick your preferred seat on the seat map
- Pay securely; tickets are stored in-app
- Show a QR ticket for quick boarding
- Track live bus location and ETAs
- Get alerts for delays, changes, or promotions
- Save favorite routes/times for one‑tap access
- View trip history and receipts

## How it works (end‑to‑end)
1. Choose your route, direction, and time window.
2. Pick a seat and confirm your booking.
3. Pay (if required) and receive a QR ticket in your wallet.
4. At boarding, present your QR for validation.
5. Get notifications for boarding time, delays, or platform changes.

## Getting started
- Create or sign in to your account
- Set your campus/organization and verify your student status if needed
- Enable notifications and location for the best experience
- Optionally add a payment method for paid routes/passes

## Key screens
- Home: next departures, favorites, active ticket
- Routes & Schedule: search, filter, route details
- Seat Map: visual seat picking and availability
- Ticket Wallet: active and past tickets/receipts
- Profile & Settings: preferences, saved methods, help

## Tips and best practices
- Save your common routes as Favorites
- Turn on notifications for boarding and gate updates
- Download your ticket ahead of time if connectivity is limited
- Keep your QR at reasonable brightness for faster scans
- If your plans change, cancel early to free up seats for others

## Accessibility
- Large text and high‑contrast modes supported by system settings
- Screen reader labels for key actions
- Reduced motion respected where supported

## Frequently asked questions
- I can’t find my route: Make sure you selected the right campus/organization and direction.
- Can I change seats? If the booking is still open, reselect on the seat map or cancel and rebook.
- What if my payment fails? You won’t be charged. Try another method or check your network.
- My QR won’t scan: Increase screen brightness and keep the code flat, not at an angle.
- Do I need internet to board? QR tickets cached on your phone can be validated offline by staff equipment where supported.

## Privacy and security
- Only essential data is collected to fulfill your booking
- Payment details are handled via secure providers; the app does not store card numbers
- You control notifications and data sharing in Settings

## Troubleshooting
- No upcoming trips appearing: Pull to refresh or check date/time filters
- App seems slow: Close background apps and check network strength
- Can’t book a seat: The departure may be full or locked; try a nearby time
